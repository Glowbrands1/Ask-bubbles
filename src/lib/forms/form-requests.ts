/**
 * ============================================================================
 * "COACHING FORM FOR AVERY AND A CA FOR JORDAN" — SEVERAL FORMS, ONE MESSAGE
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Signed-in QA, 8 Oct 2026: that message produced ONE Coaching card asking
 * "Avery or Jordan?", and the Corrective Action was never mentioned again.
 * The form path answered one request per turn, and a message with two people
 * in it read as a single request whose person was unclear.
 *
 * A manager who asks for two forms has asked for two forms. This reads the
 * message into its separate requests — each with its own form, its own person
 * and its own words — so each becomes its own proposal, its own card and its
 * own draft. What one clause says is never read into the other's form.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A SEPARATE REQUEST
 *
 *   - a clause that names a form AND asks for it with a verb or names the
 *     person it is for: "coaching form for Avery", "and a CA for Jordan";
 *   - a bare form clause beside another request: "a coaching form and a CA
 *     for Jordan" — both for Jordan, the one person named;
 *   - a further person for the form just named: "coaching forms for Avery
 *     and Jordan" — one Coaching Form each.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT
 *
 *   - a form REPLACED: "coaching form for Avery, actually make it a CA" is one
 *     form, corrected (`REPLACES_IT`), and the single-form path reads it;
 *   - a form DECLINED: "a coaching form for Avery but no CA for Jordan";
 *   - a form only CONDITIONAL: "and if Jordan is late again, a CA" — nothing
 *     has happened yet to write up (`conditionalRequests` reports these);
 *   - a topic: "coaching - policy review" names no second request.
 *
 * Fewer than two requests is null: the single-form path is unchanged.
